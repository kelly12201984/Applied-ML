## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#It Appears that Madison and the disputed papers have the most highest and matching count in cluster 6. 
```{r}
FedPapers_HAC <- FederalistPapers_original[,c(2:72)]
##Make the file names the row names.  Need a data frame of numerical values for HAC
rownames(FedPapers_HAC) <- FedPapers_HAC[,1]

FedPapers_HAC[,1] <- NULL
```

Interpretation:
The K-means clustering (k = 10) grouped essays based on function word usage. When visualizing clusters, we observe that Madison’s essays and the disputed papers are often grouped in the same cluster (notably cluster 6), suggesting stylistic similarity. Hamilton’s essays appear more broadly distributed across clusters, while Jay’s and co-authored essays are more distinct.

Insight:
Cluster assignment patterns align with historical evidence that James Madison is the more likely author of the disputed essays. This aligns with Mosteller and Wallace's original findings.


```{r}
# Compute the distance matrix
dist_matrix <- dist(FedPapers_HAC)
#dist_matrix (commented out to prevent overwhelming output)

# Perform hierarchical clustering
HAC <- hclust(dist_matrix, method = "complete")

# Plot the dendrogram with smaller font size for labels
plot(HAC, hang = -1, cex = 0.6)

```
Interpretation:
The hierarchical clustering dendrograms (complete and single linkage) show that disputed essays are often closer to Madison's essays in the tree. This further supports the finding from K-means.
```{r}
##Calculate distance using different methods
distance <- dist(FedPapers_HAC, method = "euclidean")
distance2 <- dist(FedPapers_HAC, method = "maximum")
distance3 <- dist(FedPapers_HAC, method = "manhattan")
distance4 <- dist(FedPapers_HAC, method = "canberra")
distance5 <- dist(FedPapers_HAC, method = "binary")
distance6 <- dist(FedPapers_HAC, method = "minkowski")


```


```{r}
summary(distance)
summary(distance2)
summary(distance3)
summary(distance4)
summary(distance5)
summary(distance6)

```

```{r}
HAC <- hclust(distance, method = "complete")
plot(HAC, cex=0.4, hang=-1)
rect.hclust(HAC, k=5, border=2:9)
```
```{r}
HAC2 <- hclust(distance, method = "single")
plot(HAC2, cex=0.6)
rect.hclust(HAC, k=5, border=2:8)
```
Conclusion:
Unsupervised learning methods like K-means and hierarchical clustering proved valuable in exploring historical text authorship. While not definitive, the patterns observed — including cluster groupings and proximity in dendrograms — support the hypothesis that Madison is the more likely author of the disputed Federalist Papers.
