Applied Machine Learning Projects:
This repository showcases hands-on machine learning projects completed as part of my graduate coursework in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University. The goal of each project was to apply machine learning methods to real-world datasets and extract meaningful insights using interpretable models.

Projects Included
ðŸ§  The Federalist Papers: Clustering for Authorship Attribution
Goal: Determine the likely authors (Hamilton vs. Madison) of disputed essays using clustering methods.

Techniques Used: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, EM Clustering

Focus Areas: Unsupervised learning, feature scaling, centroid analysis, cluster visualization

Outcome: Models consistently grouped disputed papers with Madisonâ€™s writing style, aligning with historical analysis.

ðŸ”¢ Digit Recognition: MNIST Classification with Interpretable Models
Goal: Classify handwritten digits using models that offer clear interpretability.

Techniques Used: Decision Trees, NaÃ¯ve Bayes

Focus Areas: Model training with cross-validation, confusion matrix analysis, pixel importance, misclassification patterns

Outcome: Achieved moderate accuracy (~60%) and revealed which digits/models struggled the most. Highlights the tradeoff between interpretability and performance.

Tools & Technologies
R, R Markdown

caret, rpart, e1071, clustering packages

Data wrangling, model evaluation, visualizations

Why This Matters
These projects reflect a thoughtful, real-world approach to data science:

Clarity in process and interpretation

Emphasis on explainability and stakeholder communication

Insight into when and why simpler models succeed or fail
